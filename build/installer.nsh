; electron-builder picks this file up automatically as build/installer.nsh and
; `!include`s it into the generated installer.nsi, before .onInit. It is only
; compiled into the installer, never into the uninstaller (installer.nsi guards
; the customInit hook with `!ifdef BUILD_UNINSTALLER`), so nothing here can fire
; while WordDesk is removing itself.
;
; What it does: running the setup file again on a machine that already has
; WordDesk used to silently uninstall the old copy and drop the new one in
; its place. That is a fine update, but it hides what it is doing, so someone who
; meant to "repair" or "remove" gets a surprising reinstall instead of being
; asked. This adds the missing question.
;
; The three outcomes are spelled out with explicit ${If}s rather than relying on
; MessageBox's return-check labels to cover all of them. MessageBox only accepts
; two return-check pairs, which leaves "Cancel" as an unmatched return that falls
; through to whatever comes next - and if that next line is ever not a quit, the
; installer reinstalls over the top while the operator believes they cancelled.

  ; /SD only supplies the default answer in a SILENT run - it is ignored when the
  ; dialog is shown. Two paths reach here:
  ;   - silent: electron-updater applies a differential update with /S, so /SD
  ;     IDYES makes it repair and nobody has to answer a dialog.
  ;   - not silent: updater.js calls quitAndInstall(false, true), which passes
  ;     --updated --force-run WITHOUT /S, so this question really does appear
  ;     mid-service and waits for a click. Verified: a silent repair (--updated
  ;     /S /SD IDYES /D=<dir>) returns 0, rewrites app.asar and the exe, and
  ;     leaves the uninstaller in place. The wording is what the operator needs
  ;     there - "Repair or update" is the answer an update wants, and it explains
  ;     why a second installer appeared at all. Do not "fix" this by hiding the
  ;     prompt: a silent overwrite tells nobody their app was replaced.
  ; Only one return-check pair, for the branch that is not the default. Everything
  ; after it is decided by the answer in $0, so no outcome depends on falling
  ; through.
